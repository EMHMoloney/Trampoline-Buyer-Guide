# The Trampoline Buyers Guide

The site has deployed through github, it can be viewed [here](https://emhmoloney.github.io/Trampoline-Buyer-Guide/)

## Planning and Value Creation

This site is aimed at those looking to buy a trampoline for home use.
It was developed on a "Mobile First" basis, with imperitive technical and safety information prioritised, leading to more general considerations, then a competion draw to add an engaging fun element.
The owner of the site could be a retailer/distributor/club/installer, or any number of persona who would gain value by establishing themselves as an authority in the field, and/or gaining potential additions to email lists through the competition.
The user can find value in the site through feeling more informed when making their purchase-I am assuming from the title that they have already decided to buy one, or are seriously considering it, and going about research before they do. They can work from the top down -from a size guide to narrow down thier choice,addition safety considerations to take into account when buying, a FAQ section for points they may or may not have considered, then a chance to win a trampoline outright.

## Validation and Testing

The HTML was validated through WC3, which threw up a few stray elements, but it is now clear bar one bug which is visible in the [report] (w3c-validation.png) bu
The CSS was validated through Jigsaw, and came up error free in the [report](jigsaw-validation.png)
Resonsiveness of the site is not up to my standards, it is quite week. The image and menu are especially poor as I allowed myself to run out of time to dig deeper and sort them as I know I can. Outside of running through previews in IDE, the screen viewers in DevTools and checking the deployed version, I didnt run it through a validator as I ran out of time to correct it, add enough media queries, and check them.

## Features

I had planned 10 features in the site as outlined in the wireframe.
I acieved 8 running well, with 2 edited out due to my time constraints.
The "submit" does not post to a separate form dump, or give feedback. These are not bugs and I know with some more time I could have been brought them up to standard- this is the big "take away" for me from this project.

### Font/Colours

A browser font had to be used, which was not my first choice. I was unable to import a Google font to the IDE. I kept recieving error messages about "parallel loading" and on reasearching the problem discovered it was to do with the system I'm operating with, so had to make do with a sans-serif font from the broswer.
Colors were chosen for high contrast rating and to define the sections of the site.

### Acessibility

The rating of 94% was achieved through [ACCESSIBILITY test]
Points were lost for labelling on form input fields, but when the labels were adjusted W3C validation flagged them, so I settled for the score presented.

#### Deployment

Deployment is through Github, in the pages section of the Code and analysis section. From thhere selct main branch/root folder deployment.
After some time ,the deployed project will be linked in the Environments section. The live version can be accessed form that link.

#### Credits

I used the favicon and text from the Love Running source code as my operating sysytem had issues running any others I tried to import- same as the the font issue outlined above.

Color combination was sourced from Coolors.co, as I could assess it for high contrast rating there.
