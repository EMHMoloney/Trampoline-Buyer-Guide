        <p>When choosing which size trampoline to buy, it's important to consider the size of your garden, and the ages of all family members who will be using it.
            <p><br>
                <p>Trampoline shape does matter when it comes to home use . Round trampolines have a relatively 'softer' bounce, and are recommended for younger children. Rectangular and square trampolines have a relatively 'harder', more reactive bounce. They are recomended for older teen, and adult use. That is why you see trained, professional gymnasts using rectangular trampolines.The rectangular trampolines in public play zones (e.g. "JumpZone") have been heavily modified for public use.</p><br>
                <p>When deciding, remember that all trampolines should have 3ft (1m) of space all around , to allow for access and safe play.</p><br>
                <p>To help you choose, refer to the chart below which shows the recommended sizes based on users ages.</p><br>

                Trampolines can provide hours of family fun out in fresh air . Screen-free too!<
                    </p>
                    <p>Safety should always be a priority when engaging in any activity with children of any age. Regular play will mean wear and tear on all play equipment, trampolines are no exception to this. 
                         Check your trampoline regularily for worn padding, exposed springs, and tears in safety enclosures. </p>
                         <p> Children with poor motor control, existing injuries, weaknessess, or illness should not use a trampoline. Indeed, this applies to users of all ages.</p>
                         <p> always read your safety booklet provided with all new trampolines. </p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Can trampolines be placed on concrete, patios, or tarmac areas?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Trampolines can be used on these surfaces , but they require anchoring and a full base of heavy duty safety pads underneath. check with your home insurance provider if they cover trampoline use in this way.
                        Most insurance providers do include trampolines under home cover policies, but do not assume yours does, always check.

                    <div class="faq-question">Can I leave my trampoline out all year ?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Manufacturers recommend dismantling and storing your trampoline in a covered location such as a shed or garage. 
                        If this is not possible then a heavy duty cover can be placed over. Special covers to fit your trampoline can be bought, but heavy tarpaulin and stong ties can also be used.
                    It is imperative to use a tie-down kit, also called an anchor kit, if your trampoline is to be left out in windy conditions- this will prevent damage to surrounding fences, walls or even worse. </div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Are trampolines good exercise?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Trampolines are wonderful, low-impact, cardiovacular and strengthening exercise. Trampoline use targets core  and leg muscles in particular.
                        balance and motor-control are also improved with regular use, but anyone who has weaknessess in those areas must be supervised closely while using trampolines. </div>
